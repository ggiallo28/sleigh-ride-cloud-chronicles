Dear Santa,

Hi! It's me, Timmy! I'm 8 years old and I live in Whitehorse with my mom, dad, and my little sister Lily (she's 5 and kind of annoying but I love her anyway).

I've been REALLY good this year, Santa. Like, super duper good. I promise! I always share my stuff and I help people all the time. I even helped Lily with her homework once, which was really hard because she doesn't know her numbers yet.

For Christmas, I would really really REALLY like a Nintendo Switch. All my friends have one and we could play together online! I also want the new Mario Kart game if that's not too much to ask. And maybe some Lego sets? I like the space ones.

Oh, and if you have room in your sleigh, my friend Sarah would love something nice too. She's always helping everyone and she planted trees on Earth Day! She's the nicest person I know.

I'll leave extra cookies for you this year - the chocolate chip ones, not the oatmeal raisin (those are gross, sorry).

Love,
Timmy

P.S. - Please say hi to the reindeer for me! Are they back from vacation yet?
