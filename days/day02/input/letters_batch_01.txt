Yo Santa!

Lucas checking in from Brampton, Ontario. This year's been wild, but I've kept it cool. 
I'm hyped about maybe getting an electric scooter. And, if you're feeling extra jolly, a virtual reality headset would blow my mind!

Stay frosty!
Lucas

Hi Santa!

Donna here, waving from Sydney, Nova Scotia. I've been trying my best to be good (most of the time).
I'm really hoping to find an Our Generation Siberian Husky Plush under the tree. And if there's room in your bag, a video game would be amazing!

Thanks for being awesome!

Hi Santa,

I'm Tammy from Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. It's been a great year, and I've tried my best to be good. 
For Christmas, I have my eyes set on a lego set. If it’s not too much trouble, I’d also love some art supplies.

Happy Holidays, Santa!

Dear Santa,

I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Lindsey, and I live in Red Deer, Alberta. 
This year, I've been on my best behavior. For Christmas, I would really love a Furby Furblets. 
If you can, I would also be thrilled to receive a skateboard.

Thank you for all the joy you bring!
Sincerely,
Lindsey

Santa, my dude!

Kevin here, repping Calgary, Alberta. I've been good(ish) this year, promise!
I'm crossing my fingers for a solar-powered phone charger. And if you're feeling extra magical, a magnetic levitating globe would make my year!

You rock, Santa!

S-man!

What's crackin'? It's Michelle from Gatineau, Quebec. I've been keeping my nose clean all year.
I'm super stoked about maybe getting a digital art drawing tablet. And if you're feeling extra jolly, a portable karaoke microphone would be off the hook!

You're a legend, Santa!

Santa, my main man!

Patricia here, chillin' in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. I've been keeping it real and staying good.
I'm dreaming of unwrapping an Apple iPad (10th Generation) on Christmas morning. And if you're feeling generous, a Squishmallows (Hello Kitty, Piplup, Adopt Me! Queen Bee) would be the cherry on top!

You're the GOAT, Santa!

Hey Santa!

What's up? It's Jordan here from Fredericton, New Brunswick. I've been crushing it this year - no coal for me, right? 😉
I'm dreaming of a Miniverse Make It Mini Food Kits under the tree. Oh, and if you've got room in that sleigh, an Apple Watch would be epic too!

You're the best, big guy!

Dear Santa Claus,

Hello! My name is Jeffrey, and I live in Vancouver, British Columbia.
I’ve been very kind and helpful this year. For Christmas, I would really like a desktop air purifier.
It would also make me so happy to have an Apple iPad Air if you can manage it.

Thank you so much, Santa!
Yours truly,
