Dear Santa Claus,

Hi! Hello! Greetings! Salutations! It's me, Emma Hunter (yes, that's my full name), writing to you from 5276 Annette Path, Laval, Quebec, I5X 7U8, Canada. I hope this letter finds you well and that you're staying warm up there at the North Pole. I imagine it must be very cold. Do you have central heating? Or do you just use fireplaces? I've always wondered about that. Also, do the elves get cold? Do they wear special thermal underwear? My mom makes me wear thermal underwear in the winter and I hate it because it's itchy, but she says it's important to stay warm. Anyway, I'm getting off track already, which my teacher Mrs. Patterson says I do a lot. She wrote on my last report card "Emma is a bright student but tends to go off on tangents." I had to look up what "tangents" meant and apparently it's when you start talking about something else in the middle of talking about the first thing. Which I guess I'm doing right now. Sorry about that.
So, I'm ten years old. Well, actually, I'll be eleven on January 15th, which is right after Christmas, so technically I'm still ten, but I feel like I should mention that I'm almost eleven because it's relevant to what I want for Christmas, which I'll get to eventually, I promise. I'm in Grade 5 at Riverside Elementary School, which is not actually near a river, which I think is false advertising, but my dad says that's just what they named it and I shouldn't take it so literally. My best friends are Sophie Chen (she sits next to me in class), Marcus Johnson (he's really good at math and helps me sometimes), and Olivia Martinez (she moved here from Mexico two years ago and speaks Spanish and English which I think is so cool). We have this whole friend group and we eat lunch together every day in the cafeteria. Usually I get the pizza on Wednesdays because that's pizza day, but sometimes the pizza is kind of soggy, so on those days I bring my lunch from home, which is usually a peanut butter and banana sandwich (I know that sounds weird but it's actually really good, you should try it if elves aren't allergic to peanuts or bananas).
I should probably tell you about my year so far because I know you need to know if I've been good or not for the whole naughty and nice list thing. So here goes: In January, I did pretty well. I helped my mom shovel the driveway after that big snowstorm we had (we got like two feet of snow, it was crazy), and I didn't complain too much even though my hands got really cold even with gloves on. I also helped my little brother Max (he's seven and sometimes really annoying but I try to be patient) with his homework when he was having trouble with subtraction. What else happened in January? Oh right, I forgot to feed our goldfish Gerald for like three days because I was really into this book series I was reading (Wings of Fire, have you heard of it? It's about dragons and it's amazing), and my mom got mad at me, but Gerald didn't die or anything, he was fine. So I don't know if that counts as naughty or just forgetful. Probably somewhere in between.
February was okay. Valentine's Day was fun. I made valentines for everyone in my class, even Timothy Carter who picks his nose (I know I shouldn't judge but it's kind of gross). I used construction paper and stickers and it took me like four hours but they turned out really nice. Sophie said mine were the prettiest ones. I got a lot of valentines too, including one from this boy named Jake who I think might like me, but I'm not really interested in that stuff yet, you know? Boys are kind of immature at this age. Well, most of them. Marcus is pretty mature but that's because he has three older sisters so he's used to being around girls. Anyway, in February I also accidentally broke my mom's favorite coffee mug. It was the one that said "World's Best Mom" that I gave her for Mother's Day two years ago, and I felt really bad about it. I didn't mean to, I was just putting it in the dishwasher and it slipped. I cried about it and my mom said it was okay, accidents happen, but I still felt terrible. I tried to glue it back together but it didn't work very well. So I'm not sure if that counts against me on the naughty list since it was an accident.
March was pretty good! That's when we had March Break and my family went to visit my grandparents in Thunder Bay. It's really far, like an eight-hour drive, and I got carsick about halfway there, which was not fun. But seeing my grandparents was nice. My grandma makes the best chocolate chip cookies in the entire world (no offense to Mrs. Claus if she makes cookies too, I'm sure hers are also very good). My grandpa taught me how to play cribbage, which is this card game that's kind of complicated but really fun once you figure it out. I won two games out of the seven we played, which I think is pretty good for a beginner. We also went snowmobiling, which was AMAZING. Have you ever been snowmobiling, Santa? I guess you probably prefer reindeer and sleighs, but you should try a snowmobile sometime, it's like flying but on snow. Anyway, during that trip I was pretty well-behaved except for one time when I argued with Max about who got to sit by the window in the car, and I maybe said some things I shouldn't have said, but I apologized later so hopefully that counts for something.
April was when things got a bit more complicated. School was getting harder because we started learning long division, which is honestly the worst thing ever invented. I don't understand why we need to learn it when calculators exist. My teacher says it's important to understand how math works, not just get the right answer, but I still think it's unnecessary. I got a C on one of my math tests, which I wasn't happy about, but then I studied really hard and got a B+ on the next one, so I think that shows improvement and dedication, which are good qualities, right? Also in April, I may have "borrowed" one of Sophie's gel pens without asking and then forgot to give it back for like two weeks. When I finally remembered and gave it back, she wasn't even mad, she had forgotten about it too. But I know I should have asked first, so I'm mentioning it here in the interest of full transparency.
May was pretty busy. We had to do this science fair project and I did mine on "The Effect of Different Liquids on Plant Growth" where I watered plants with water, orange juice, milk, and soda to see which one grew best. Obviously water won, but the plant with orange juice did surprisingly okay. The milk one died pretty fast though, and it smelled really bad. I got second place in my class, which I was happy about. Sophie got first place with her volcano project, which was admittedly pretty cool even though volcanos are kind of overdone if you ask me. In May I also joined the school choir, which practices every Tuesday after school. I'm not the best singer but I'm not the worst either, I'm sort of in the middle. We're going to perform at the winter concert in December and I'm a little nervous about it but also excited. Oh, and in May I also got in trouble for talking too much in class. Mrs. Patterson had to move my seat away from Sophie because we kept giggling about inside jokes and not paying attention. I was pretty upset about it at the time, but I understand why she did it, and I have been trying to focus more.
June was the end of the school year, which was both exciting and sad. Exciting because summer vacation, sad because I really like school (I know that's kind of nerdy but it's true). On the last day of school, I gave Mrs. Patterson a card thanking her for being a good teacher, even though she moves my seat sometimes. I also gave cards to Sophie, Marcus, and Olivia saying they're great friends. We all promised to hang out during the summer and we actually did, which was nice. I passed Grade 4 with pretty good grades - mostly B's and A's, except for that one C in math that one time, but overall my report card was good. My parents were proud of me. They took me and Max out for ice cream to celebrate the end of the school year, and I got mint chocolate chip, which is my favorite flavor, although sometimes I also like cookie dough, it depends on my mood.
July was all about summer. We went to my aunt and uncle's cottage in Muskoka for a week, which was really fun. They have a lake right there and we went swimming every day. I learned how to dive off the dock without doing a belly flop, which took a lot of practice and resulted in a lot of belly flops first, which hurt. My cousin Jessica (she's thirteen) taught me. She's really cool and good at sports. We also went canoeing and I only fell out of the canoe once, and it was partly Max's fault because he was rocking the boat on purpose. I may have yelled at him a bit more than necessary, but in my defense, the water was really cold and I was startled. We made up later though, and we roasted marshmallows together that night. I ate like six marshmallows and felt kind of sick, but it was worth it.
August was mostly just hanging out and enjoying the last bit of summer before school started again. Sophie and I had a lemonade stand one weekend and we made $23.47, which we split evenly ($11.73 each and we donated the extra cent to charity, well, we put it in the charity jar at the grocery store). We were pretty proud of ourselves. I also read a lot of books in August. I'm really into reading. I finished the entire Wings of Fire series (fifteen books!) and started on this other series called The Land of Stories. Reading is probably my favorite hobby. I know some kids think it's boring but I think it's like watching a movie in your head but better because you can imagine everything however you want. Do you like reading, Santa? I bet you have to read a lot of letters this time of year. This one is probably one of the longer ones, sorry about that. I just want to make sure I explain everything properly.
September was back to school. Grade 5! I was excited but also nervous because I heard Grade 5 is when school gets really serious and you have to start thinking about middle school and stuff. My teacher is Mr. Thompson and he's pretty nice, although he's stricter than Mrs. Patterson was. He has a rule about no talking when he's talking, which is fair but also hard for me because I have a lot of thoughts and sometimes they just come out of my mouth. I've gotten a few warnings about that but I'm working on it. I'm trying to write down my thoughts in a notebook instead of saying them out loud. It helps sometimes. In September I also joined the school's book club, which meets every other Thursday at lunch. We're reading a different book each month and then we discuss it. This month we read "Wonder" which made me cry like four times. It's really good, you should read it if you have time, although I guess you're probably busy with Christmas stuff.
October was Halloween month, which is exciting even though it's not as exciting as Christmas (obviously). I dressed up as Hermione Granger from Harry Potter because I love those books and I already had the right kind of hair (bushy and brown, which I used to not like but now I think it's cool because Hermione is awesome). Sophie was Luna Lovegood, Marcus was Ron Weasley, and Olivia was Professor McGonagall, so we had a whole theme going. We went trick-or-treating together in my neighborhood and we got SO much candy. Like, an unreasonable amount of candy. My mom made me put half of it in a bowl to "share with the family" which I was not happy about, but I understand the concept of moderation and not eating so much candy that you get sick. I may have snuck a few extra pieces when she wasn't looking, but just a few. Also in October, I forgot to study for a spelling test and got a D, which was really bad. I felt terrible about it and I promised myself I would never let that happen again. Since then I've been studying more and my grades have been better, so I think that shows that I learned from my mistake.
November has been pretty good so far. We had Thanksgiving (Canadian Thanksgiving is in October but my family celebrates American Thanksgiving too because my dad is from the United States, so we basically get two Thanksgivings which is awesome). I helped my mom make pumpkin pie and I only burned myself on the oven once, and it wasn't even that bad, just a little red mark that went away after a few hours. We had a big dinner with turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce and green beans and rolls and so much food. I ate until I thought I might explode. Then we went around the table and said what we were thankful for. I said I was thankful for my family and my friends and my health and books and also for Gerald the goldfish still being alive despite my occasional forgetfulness about feeding him (I'm much better about it now, I set a reminder on my iPad).
At school, we started this big project about Canadian history and we have to do presentations in December. I'm doing mine on the Underground Railroad in Canada, which is really interesting. A lot of enslaved people from the United States escaped to Canada to be free, and I think that's an important story that people should know about. I've been working really hard on my presentation and I think it's going to be good. Mr. Thompson said my research was very thorough, which made me feel proud.
I should also mention some of my other interests and hobbies because maybe that will help you understand what kind of gifts I might like. I really love reading, as I mentioned. My favorite genres are fantasy and adventure, but I also like realistic fiction sometimes, and I'm starting to get into mystery books too. I also like drawing, although I'm not very good at it. I mostly draw animals and fantasy creatures like dragons and unicorns. I'm better at drawing animals than people because people are hard to get the proportions right. I also like playing outside when the weather is nice - riding my bike, playing tag, climbing trees (I'm actually pretty good at climbing trees, I can get pretty high up). I like listening to music too. My favorite artists are Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, although I also listen to a lot of Disney soundtracks because those songs are catchy and fun to sing along to.
I'm also interested in science, especially animals and space. I think marine biology seems like a really cool job because the ocean is so mysterious and there are so many creatures we haven't even discovered yet. But I also think being an astronaut would be amazing because imagine going to space and seeing Earth from far away and maybe walking on Mars or something. Although both of those jobs seem really hard and you have to study a lot, so I don't know if I'd actually want to do them, but they're cool to think about. Maybe I'll be a teacher like Mrs. Patterson or Mr. Thompson, because they get to help kids learn things and that seems nice. Or maybe I'll be a writer and write books that kids like me would want to read. Or maybe something else entirely that I haven't even thought of yet. I'm only ten (almost eleven) so I have time to figure it out.
I should probably also tell you about my family in more detail since you probably want to know about that too. My mom's name is Catherine and she works as a nurse at the hospital. She works really hard and sometimes she has night shifts which means she sleeps during the day and works at night, and on those days we have to be really quiet in the house so we don't wake her up. It's hard to be quiet sometimes but I try my best. My dad's name is Miguel and he's a high school math teacher, which is kind of ironic because I'm not great at math, but he's very patient about helping me with my homework. He doesn't get mad when I don't understand something right away, he just explains it a different way until it makes sense. Both of my parents are really nice and I love them a lot, even when they make rules I don't like, like bedtime at 9pm on school nights (I think 9:30 would be more reasonable but they say I need my sleep).
My little brother Max is seven and in Grade 2. He's obsessed with dinosaurs and he can name like fifty different types of dinosaurs and tell you facts about all of them. It's actually pretty impressive. He's also really into Lego and he builds these elaborate creations that he leaves all over the house, and sometimes I step on a Lego piece with my bare foot and it hurts SO bad, but I try not to yell at him because it's not really his fault, he just forgets to clean up sometimes. We fight sometimes, like all siblings do, but most of the time we get along okay. He looks up to me because I'm his big sister, and I try to be a good role model for him, although I'm not always perfect at it.
We also have Gerald the goldfish, who I already mentioned. We've had him for two years, which is apparently pretty long for a goldfish. We also used to have a hamster named Mr. Whiskers but he died last year and we were all really sad about it. We buried him in the backyard and had a little funeral and everything. Max cried for like two days. We haven't gotten another hamster because my mom says she's not ready yet, which I understand. Losing a pet is hard.

Okay, so now I should probably get to the actual point of this letter, which is what I want for Christmas. I know I've been rambling a lot (tangents again, sorry Mrs. Patterson would be shaking her head at me right now), but I wanted to give you the full context of my year and my life so you could make an informed decision about what to bring me. That's what my dad always says - "make informed decisions" - so I'm trying to give you all the information you need.

So, here's what I'm hoping for this Christmas:

BOOKS: I would really love some new books. Specifically, I've been wanting to read:
- The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien (I've heard it's really good and it's about a dragon and an adventure)
- The Girl Who Drank the Moon by Kelly Barnhill (Sophie read it and said it was amazing)
- Any Percy Jackson books (I've read the first two but there are more in the series)
- The Mysterious Benedict Society series (my librarian recommended it)
- Maybe some graphic novels too, like Amulet or Smile or Sisters

ART SUPPLIES: I mentioned I like drawing, so some nice art supplies would be great:
- A good sketchbook with thick paper that doesn't bleed through
- Some decent colored pencils (the ones I have now are old and some of the colors are all used up)
- Maybe some markers? The kind that don't dry out super fast
- An instruction book on how to draw dragons or animals or something

A JOURNAL OR DIARY: I think it would be nice to have a proper journal where I could write down my thoughts and stories. Maybe one with a lock? Not because I have deep dark secrets or anything, just because it feels more special that way. And it would stop Max from reading it (he's nosy sometimes).

MUSIC STUFF: I've been really wanting to learn how to play an instrument. Maybe:
- A ukulele? They seem easier than guitar and they sound really pretty
- Or a keyboard? A small one that I could keep in my room
- Sheet music or a beginner's instruction book for whatever instrument I get

BOARD GAMES OR PUZZLES: My family likes doing game nights and we've played all our games like a million times, so some new ones would be fun:
- Ticket to Ride (I've played it at Sophie's house and it's really fun)
- Catan (my cousin Jessica has it and said it's good once you understand the rules)
- Maybe a really hard puzzle, like 1000 pieces, that we could work on together?

SCIENCE KIT: Some kind of science experiment kit would be cool. Not chemistry because remember Tommy's chemistry set from Day 4 and the safety concerns? But maybe something like:
- A crystal growing kit
- A microscope (even just a basic one)
- A rock tumbler
- Something about astronomy or planets

CLOTHING (I know this sounds boring but hear me out):
- I've been really wanting a hoodie that says something funny or has a cool design, maybe something book-related?
- Some fuzzy socks (even though I joked about not wanting socks before, I actually do like fuzzy socks in the winter)
- A scarf in my favorite colors (purple and teal)

ROOM DECORATION: My room is kind of plain and I'd like to make it more... me. So maybe:
- String lights (the kind with warm white lights that aren't too bright)
- Some posters (Harry Potter, dragons, space, books, that kind of thing)
- A beanbag chair to sit in while reading?
- One of those star projectors that makes your ceiling look like the night sky

GIFT CARDS: I know this is kind of impersonal but sometimes it's nice to be able to choose your own stuff:
- A bookstore gift card (so I can pick out books I want)
- An art supply store gift card
- Maybe iTunes gift card for music or audiobooks?

OTHER RANDOM STUFF that would be cool:
- A good water bottle (mine is kind of old and doesn't keep water cold anymore)
- A reading pillow (the kind with arms that you can lean back on)
- A flashlight for reading under the covers (even though I'm not supposed to stay up late reading, sometimes I do anyway, sorry Mom and Dad if you're somehow reading this)
- A camera? Even just a cheap digital camera so I could take pictures of things I think are interesting
- A terrarium kit to grow little plants in my room
- Friendship bracelet making supplies (those are popular at school right now)

I know that's a LOT of stuff and I obviously don't expect to get everything on this list. I'm just giving you options so you can choose what you think is best. My parents always say that Christmas isn't about getting a lot of presents, it's about spending time with family and being grateful for what you have. And I am grateful! I know I'm lucky to have a house and a family and food and all the things I need. There are a lot of kids who don't have those things, and I think about that sometimes. We donate to the food bank and to toy drives and stuff because it's important to help people who need it. So I guess what I'm saying is, whatever you think is appropriate would be great. I'll be happy with anything, honestly.

I should probably also mention what Max wants for Christmas since I'm already writing this letter and I could save you some reading time:
- Anything dinosaur related (toy dinosaurs, dinosaur books, dinosaur pajamas, etc.)
- Lego sets (he specifically mentioned something about a Lego City set with vehicles)
- A bike helmet with dinosaurs on it (his current helmet is plain blue and he says it's boring)
- Some kind of science kit about dinosaurs or fossils
- Hot Wheels cars (he has a collection)

Max is a pretty easy kid to shop for because he basically just loves dinosaurs and Legos.

I'm trying to think if there's anything else I should tell you. Oh! I should mention that I've been trying really hard to be good, especially these last few months. I know I mentioned some of my mistakes earlier in the year (the broken mug, the borrowed pen, the talking in class, the D on the spelling test, etc.), but I've really been working on being better. I've been:
- Helping more around the house without being asked (mostly)
- Being more patient with Max
- Trying harder in school, especially in math
- Being a good friend to Sophie, Marcus, and Olivia
- Feeding Gerald consistently
- Being respectful to my teachers
- Doing my homework without procrastinating (usually)
- Being kind to people, even when they're not kind to me

Nobody's perfect, and I know I'm not perfect either. But I'm trying, and I think that counts for something. My grandma always says "all you can do is your best," and I think I'm doing my best, or at least something pretty close to it.

I hope you and Mrs. Claus are doing well. I hope the elves are happy and healthy. I hope the reindeer are ready for their big flight on Christmas Eve (tell Rudolph I said hi, especially, because his story is my favorite). I hope you're staying safe and not too stressed out with all the letters and toy-making and list-checking and everything else you have to do this time of year.

Thank you for reading this whole letter. I know it's really long and you probably have a million other letters to read, so I appreciate you taking the time to read all of mine. I promise next year I'll try to be more concise, but I just had a lot to say this year.

Merry Christmas, Santa! I believe in you and in the magic of Christmas and in the importance of being good to others and in the joy of giving and receiving and in family and friendship and all the good things in the world.

With love and candy canes and Christmas cookies and all the holiday spirit,

Emma Hunter

P.S. - I'll leave some cookies and milk out for you on Christmas Eve. Do you have a preference for what kind of cookies? We usually do chocolate chip but I could convince my mom to make something different if you want. Let me know. Wait, you can't let me know because you don't write back. That's okay, chocolate chip is a safe choice. Everyone likes chocolate chip.

P.P.S. - I'll make sure to leave some carrots for the reindeer too.

P.P.P.S. - Is it true that you can see us when we're sleeping and you know when we're awake? Because that's kind of creepy if you think about it too hard, but also I guess it makes sense for the whole naughty and nice list thing. Just wanted to mention that.

P.P.P.P.S. - Sorry this letter is so long. I really didn't mean for it to be this long when I started. It just kind of happened. Tangents, you know?

P.P.P.P.P.S. - Okay I'm done now. For real this time. Bye!

P.P.P.P.P.P.S. - Wait, one more thing - if you ever need a helper elf or something, I would totally be interested in that as a job when I'm older. Just putting that out there.

P.P.P.P.P.P.P.S. - NOW I'm really done. Merry Christmas!
