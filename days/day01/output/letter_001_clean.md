# Letter Summary

**Child's Name:** Lucas Walsh  
**Location:** Brampton, Ontario, Canada  
**Date:** 2024-11-17  

**Core Wish:** Lucas is asking for an electric scooter and a virtual reality headset. He prefers a scooter that is fun but not too fast, and he is excited about VR games such as those involving dinosaurs or boxing.

**Context:**  
Lucas describes his year as hectic but says he has been trying his best. His cat frequently disrupts his typing, and he mentions autocorrect issues and a friend's AI app adding unnecessary emojis. He specifically asks Santa not to confuse his address again after last year's delivery mistake.

**Notes:**  
The original letter contained slang, jokes, repeated emojis, self-interruptions, and unrelated text caused by his cat and an AI writing assistant. These elements were removed to focus on the core request.
