YO Saaaaaanta!!! 🎅🔥🔥 What’s up my red-suit legend??

It’s ya boy LUCAS WALSH from BRAMPTON (Ontario, Canada, you know, near that giant parking lot everyone calls Toronto lol 😂).
Address is still the same btw: 8727 Eaton Mount, Brampton, N2D 0E1, pls don’t mix it up again, last year my neighbor got my candy canes!! 😤🍬

Anyway, listen up, this year has been a *whole saga*, like full Netflix season vibes.
School’s been wild, my little cousin keeps unplugging my stuff, AND my cat keeps sitting on my keyboard (if this letter has random letters blame him).
Example: lksdjflksdjf 🐈‍⬛ smashing keys again omg

So yeah Santa bro, I’ve been TRYING my best. Mostly.
Okay like 87% of the time.
Fine like 73%.
Okay okay like 65% BUT STILL GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT 😭😭

Anywayyyys here’s what I’m hype about this year:

🔥 **AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER** one of those fast ones, but like not too fast because my mom will freak out. Maybe red? Or black? Or whatever, surprise me.
⚡ **A virtual reality headset** the one where you can see dinosaurs in your living room?? Or like play those boxing games?? My friend tried one and punched a lamp so maybe warn me first 😂🥊💡

Oh oh OH also if your AI elves or whatever you got now can like recommend the "best scooter for someone who crashes into garbage cans sometimes" that would be amazing 👍😂

Also sorry if this is long, I tried writing it earlier but the pen broke so I typed it and then my autocorrect freaked out and then I asked my friend’s “smart AI helper” app to “make it cooler” and it added like 47 emojis I had to delete but I think some are still here 😬
It also told me to manifest my “inner snowman energy”???? idk why ☃️💫

Anyway Santa my guy, hope you're chillin up there in the North Pole and not freezing your beard off lol.
Stay frosty, stay merry, and don’t work too hard, drink water and stretch your elf legs or whatever you do!

Much love,
LUCAS ❄️😎❄️
